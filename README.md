# RHEL9-STIG-compliance-lab
ðŸ”¸ Project Overview

* This project demonstrates end-to-end DISA STIG compliance for a RHEL9 EC2 instance in AWS. It includes baseline scanning, automated hardening with Ansible, post-hardening validation with OpenSCAP, continuous monitoring with AIDE, and documentation of residual findings in a POA&M.

ðŸ”¸ Tools & Frameworks

OpenSCAP â€“ scanning/assessment

Ansible STIG Role â€“ automated remediation

AIDE â€“ file integrity monitoring (SI-7)

scap-security-guide â€“ DISA STIG checklists

POA&M tracking â€“ compliance documentation

ðŸ”¸ Workflow

Baseline Scan â€“ captured baseline-report.html and compliance breakdown (~50â€“60% pass).

Hardening with Ansible â€“ applied STIG role.

Post-Hardening Scan â€“ improved compliance (~82%).

Continuous Monitoring â€“ installed/configured AIDE, scheduled daily checks.

POA&M â€“ documented residual fails with remediation milestones.

ðŸ”¸ Key Takeaways

Automated compliance scanning & remediation.

Demonstrated the full RMF cycle: Scan â†’ Remediate â†’ Validate â†’ Monitor â†’ Document.

Learned how to handle residual findings with a POA&M.

This workflow mirrors what DoD/FedRAMP teams use in production.
