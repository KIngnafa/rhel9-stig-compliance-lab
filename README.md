# ðŸ“Œ RHEL9 STIG Compliance Lab

ðŸ”¸ **Project Overview**  
This project demonstrates end-to-end DISA STIG compliance for a RHEL9 EC2 instance in AWS. It includes baseline scanning, automated hardening with Ansible, post-hardening validation with OpenSCAP, continuous monitoring with AIDE, and documentation of residual findings in a POA&M.

---

ðŸ”¸ **Tools & Frameworks**
- **OpenSCAP** â€“ scanning/assessment  
- **Ansible STIG Role** â€“ automated remediation  
- **AIDE** â€“ file integrity monitoring (SI-7)  
- **scap-security-guide** â€“ DISA STIG checklists  
- **POA&M tracking** â€“ compliance documentation  

---

ðŸ”¸ **Workflow**
1. **Baseline Scan** â€“ captured `baseline-report.html` and compliance breakdown (~50â€“60% pass).  
2. **Hardening with Ansible** â€“ applied STIG role.  
3. **Post-Hardening Scan** â€“ improved compliance (~82%).  
4. **Continuous Monitoring** â€“ installed/configured AIDE, scheduled daily checks.  
5. **POA&M** â€“ documented residual fails with remediation milestones.
